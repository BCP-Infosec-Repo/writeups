## FireEye FLARE-On 6 Write-ups

Flare-On 6 was every bit as awesome as we have all come to expect from [@fireeye]'s FLARE team. This
year had another wonderful mix of fun and interesting challenges each demonstrating a unique quirk or
technical insight. Personally I had a lot of fun solving all the challenges and learned an amazing amount
of new tricks and bits of arcana. As usual, all challenges were engineered to the high standard we
have all come to expect from the FLARE team.

My thanks go out to all the authors who clearly spent a significant amount of time thinking up and
developing the challanges (not to mention getting the mix of humour and frustration right).
Thank you [@nickharbour], Eamon Walsh, [@m_r_tz], [@t00manybananas], [@spresec], [@sandornemes],
[@AlexRRich], Sebastian Vogl, [@MalwareMechanic], [@dhanesh_k], [@NOPandRoll].

The write-ups tend to follow my route through the challenges, but I do take the
odd detour to point out alternative methods or interesting tricks. I am including
the code for all the tools I 'developed' to solve the challenges. Although
some of these tools will generalize, they are far from being production-grade code.

As usual I recommend that you get the challenge binaries and follow my footsteps
in IDA or other tool of your choice.

Enjoy the journey,
